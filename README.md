# Website Description
A "start your day" webpage that uses APIs to serve up the weather, top news for the day, recipes, a book recommendation, and/or a random fact/joke/Kanye quote.

# Our Pitch
The hardest part of any day is starting it. Daily Drop exists to provide all the essential information needed to start your day, along with some fun tidbits to make you smile and some helpful ideas for making the most of your day. Whether you need to check the weather, read the news, find your next breakfast recipe or make fun of Kanye, **Daily Drop** has what you need. Our user-centric site can also be customized to maximize its utility - choose news categories that align with your interests or change the theme color, and save it all to your account!

**Daily Drop**: *Drop of Daily*
